<h1>Divide & Conquer(DC)<br></h1>
May 16 2020<br><br>
         DC is about splitting big problem into small problems and solving them recursively.
The small problems must also be like big problem. 
Say for example, DC can be applied to a sort funtion where the input set is split into multiple small chunks of sort elements and can be resolved recursively.<br><br>
DC is not about splitting a big module whose functions are different, say for eg diving a monolith into small chunks.

l = low will be the first element<br>
h = high will be the last element<br>
Middle = Math.floor(l+h/2)
