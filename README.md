<h1>Divide & Conquer(DC)<br></h1>
May 16 2020<br><br>
         DC is about splitting big problem into small problems and solving them recursively.
The small problems must also be like big problem. 
Say for example, DC can be applied to a sort funtion where the input set is split into multiple small chunks of sort elements and can be resolved recursively.<br>
DC is not about splitting a big module whose functions are different, say for eg diving a monolith into small chunks.
